  <strong>‚Äãhumanoid_deploy‚Äã‚Äã is a multi-policy robot deployment framework based on a state-switching mechanism. Currently, the included policies are designed for the ‚Äã‚ÄãUnitree G1 robot (29-DoF)‚Äã‚Äã.</strong>

## Repository

This is the official repository: [https://github.com/bethalageetachandraraju/Humanoid_realworld_deployment.git](https://github.com/bethalageetachandraraju/Humanoid_realworld_deployment.git)

---

## Preface

- **‚ÄãThis deployment framework is only applicable to G1 robots with a 3-DOF waist. If a waist fixing bracket is installed, it must be unlocked according to the official tutorial before this framework can be used normally.‚Äã‚Äã**

- **It is recommended to remove the hands, as dance movements may cause interference.‚Äã**

## Installation and Configuration

## 1. Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to run training or deployment programs in a virtual environment. We suggest using Conda to create one.

### 1.1 Create a New Environment

Use the following command to create a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n robomimic python=3.8
```

### 1.2 Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
conda activate robomimic
```

## 3. Operation Instructions in Simulation

To control the robot in simulation, use the following keyboard shortcuts directly in the terminal after starting the simulation:

```bash
python deploy_mujoco/deploy_mujoco.py
```

## 4. Real Robot Operation Instructions

1. Power on the robot and suspend it (e.g., with a harness). and then hold L2+R2

2. Run the deploy_real program:
```bash
python deploy_real/deploy_real.py
```
3. Press the ‚Äã‚ÄãStart‚Äã‚Äã button to enter position control mode.
4. Subsequent operations are the same as in simulation.

### **Horse Stance (NEW)**
- To activate the Horse Stance policy on the real robot, hold **B + R1** on the remote controller.
- The robot will switch to the Horse Stance policy.

### **Adding/Running Future New Policies**
- To add a new policy:
    1. Implement your policy in a new folder under `policy/` (see `policy/horse_stance/` as an example).
    2. Register your policy in `FSM/FSM.py` by adding it to the FSM class and `get_next_policy`.
    3. Add a new command mapping in `deploy_real/deploy_real.py` (see the Horse Stance example: `KeyMap.B` + `KeyMap.R1`).
    4. Add your policy's configuration and ONNX model as needed.
- To run your new policy, use the corresponding button combination you defined in `deploy_real/deploy_real.py`.

## Important Notes
### 1. Framework Compatibility Notice
The current framework does not natively support deployment on G1 robots equipped with Orin NX platforms. Preliminary analysis suggests compatibility issues with the `unitree_python_sdk` on Orin systems. For onboard Orin deployment, we recommend the following alternative solution:

- Replace with [unitree_sdk2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2) (official C++ SDK)
- Implement a dual-node ROS architecture:
  - **C++ Node**: Handles data transmission between robot and controller
  - **Python Node**: Dedicated to policy inference

### 2. Mimic Policy Reliability Warning
The Mimic policy does not guarantee 100% success rate, particularly on slippery/sandy surfaces. In case of robot instability:
- Press `F1` to activate **PassiveMode** (damping protection)
- Press `Select` to immediately terminate the control program

### 3. Charleston Dance (R1+X) - Stable Policy Notes
Currently the only verified stable policy on physical robots:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Precautions**:
- **Palm Removal Recommended**: The original training didn't account for palm collisions (author's G1 lacked palms)
- **Initial/Final Stabilization**: Brief manual stabilization may be required when starting/ending the dance
- **Post-Dance Transition**: While switching to **Locomotion/PositionControl/PassiveMode** is possible, we recommend:
  - First transition to **PositionControl** or **PassiveMode**
  - Provide manual stabilization during transition

### 4. Other Movement Advisories
All other movements are currently **not recommended** for physical robot deployment.

### 5. Strong Recommendation
**Always** master operations in simulation before attempting physical robot deployment.
